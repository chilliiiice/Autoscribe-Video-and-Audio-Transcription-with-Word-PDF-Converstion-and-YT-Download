Must have ffmpeg first https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows or https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/.

Once zip files are extracted to your designated location, copy the ffmpeg bin folder path (example: "ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl\bin") and search Edit Eystem Environment Variables in search bar. At the bottom, you'll see System Variables, then System Variables → find and select Path → Edit → New → paste your bin path. Enjoy :)
